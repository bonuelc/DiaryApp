# DiaryApp

Treehouse iOS Techdegree Project #10

For this project, you will create a Core Data based Diary App in Swift. You will be responsible for creating the data layer, all code as well as the UI. You are free to follow the mockups provided or design your own UI, provided the user experience is clear. Given the relatively short feature set for this app, students should give special attention to writing clean, extensible code, unit tests, error handling and selecting just the right Swift language “tools” for the job. If that means lots of refactoring and getting peer reviews prior to submission, we hope you take the time to do so.

Be sure your app offers the following features, at a minimum:

- A basic master-detail view architecture
- Ability to create text journal entries, which should display a timestamp
- Ability to edit and/or delete an existing journal entries
- Ability to add geolocation data to an entry
- Comprehensive unit testing coverage for your code

In order to gain a rating of exceeds expectations, please implement at least TWO of the following features:

- Ability to add a photo, or multiple photos to an entry
- Ability to add a voice memo or sound file to an entry
- Ability to share an entry via email, Facebook or Twitter
- Ability to search all entries via a search bar on the Master View

For those features listed as extra credit, you may employ third party libraries, if you find that helpful.

# Before you start

To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

- Download the project mockups and assets. You don’t have to use them and are free to create your own look and feel, but might also choose to use the mockups and assets as a jumping-off point.

# Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

- You are free to submit this project in either Swift 2.3 or Swift 3. For Swift 2.3, if you are using Xcode 8, you will need to download and use the empty Swift 2.3 starter files template to start your project.
- Create a Core Data driven Diary app, utilizing a TableView-based approach, with both Master and Details View.
- Ensure users can scroll through the Master View to see a list of existing entries as well as tap on existing entries to see the Detail View, delete existing entries or add a new entry.
- Ensure users can create, edit and save entries once on a Detail View. All entries should record and display either their “created-on” and/or “last changed-on” date.
- Add functionality such that users can add geolocation data to an entry.
- Add comprehensive unit testing coverage to your app.
- Ensure that you app looks good and performs well on all iPhones, models 5, 6+ and beyond.

# Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you must implement all of the following features:

- Add the ability to add a photo, or multiple photos to an entry.
- Add the ability to add a voice memo or sound file to an entry.
